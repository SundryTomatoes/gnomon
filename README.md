# gnomon

Gnomon is a multi-faceted visualization project that explores patterns encoded in the light and color schemes of the world around me. Using vectorized image arrays, clustering algorithms, and advanced visualization tools, Gnomon transforms an album of photographs into a dataset that makes illuminating and unexpected connections about my life and experience during a single week. 

Gnomon is named after the part of a sundial that casts a shadow and allows observers to know the time of day to a surprisingly precise degree. Using this simple technology, scientists were even able to estimate the Earth's circumference some fifteen hundred years before explorers crossed the Atlantic. The gnomon represents the great lengths scientists were able to go with such seemingly primitive techniques. 

This project uses current technology to make observations about experience, time, and space.
